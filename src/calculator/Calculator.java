 * @version 5.00 2019-02-19 Aakash Sharma tested the methods so that it properly
 *          works. Aakash Sharma added the log method to calculate the log base 2
 * 
 * @version 6.00 2019-03-20 Aakash Sharma added the FSM code Aakash Sharma added the

 *
 * @version 7.00 2019-03-25 Aakash Sharma work on the UI of the Calculator. Aman
 *          Verma add the code in the Error term operands The code of the FSM
 *          has been taken from the W8D3 Study Hall Activity.
 * 
 * @version 7.10 2019-03-25 Aakash Sharma work on the UI of the Calculator and
 *          FSM. Add the code in the Error term operands
 *
 * @version 8.00 2019-10-23 Aakash Sharma work on the UI of the Calculator and
 *          the UNumber in this previous version . Add the code for using the
 *          UNumber code in calculator.
 * @version 9.00 2019-10-23 Aakash Sharma work on the UI of the Calculator and
 *          the UNumber in this previous version . Add the code for using the
